# ikccd
IK Solver using Cyclic Coordinate Descent made for Unity3D

Currently works perfectly on the X-Y plane. 

Run the IKSolve scene and move around the Target GameObject.


Locate the IKSolver GameObject and add new joints to the IKSolver script as necessary, with Root being the first element and End-joint being the last.


The solver also works with 3D now.
