# ikccd
IK Solver using Cyclic Coordinate Descent made for Unity3D

# How to Run the Solver
 - Run the IKSolve scene and move around the Target GameObject.


 - Locate the IKSolver GameObject and add new joints to the IKSolver script as necessary, with Root being the first element and End-joint being the last.


 - The solver also works with 3D now, so don't be afraid (I'm not) to go beyond the safezone that is the xy Plane.
